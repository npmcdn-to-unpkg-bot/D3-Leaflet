Notes from wed night: 
Pop ups only on click
Maybe schools on hover?
Question mark in top corner for help box which includes directions like click for details and zoom in to see schools and a general about for the map

Need to:
change pop-up box shape?
add label svgs
format box text weights
search/checkbox thing


To do at work - average data from skykomish schools and add to district data
				add ESL% for schools
				change icon color with photoshop
